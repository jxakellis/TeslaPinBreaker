# TeslaPinBreaker
Description
Uses the unofficial Tesla API to brute force and find the four digit speed limit mode password. Speed limit mode heavily limits the acceleration and top speed. Program is unoptimized as it was a hacky way to accomplish my goal of disabiling SLM. Improvements to be made: Correct JSON parsing & user friendly way to navigate between multiple vehicles.

To Use
Currently setup for our two car Tesla account, may crash if account only has one. Adjust code to fit your use case
